###ABOUT ME 
#I like making apps (which I'm trying to make as my primary source of income), working out (calisthenics), reading books (mainly non-fiction), learning to be more compassionate & kinder, meditation, parenting & travelling. And on the blog I'll write about all these, my thoughts on them & what I'm doing to get more acquainted with them. I hope you enjoy reading.
