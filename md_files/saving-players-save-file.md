#TITLE Saving playerâ€™s save file to a safe location

#If you're familiar with games on Windows, you may have come across the <b>AppData/Local</b> folder. Each user on the computer has their own AppData folder and is the default place to save things like a player's save state.
#Why canâ€™t you just save it to the folder your game is installed in?
#Different users on the computer might not want another user seeing their save state.
#And, importantly from a programming standpoint, depending on where the user installs your game, you might not have permission to write to your game folder. Making the game either crash or not save the playerâ€™s progress, either one not good.
#So the solution to this is saving it in a file location that is unique to each user and the os expects things to write in this location. This is what the AppData/ folder is for-saving things like user settings and progress files, which can be loaded up again when the user starts the program again.
#We will be saving our data in the Local folder. The Roaming folder is used by online programs to synchronize the user's data across machines. Whereas Local and LocalLow are specific to that machine.
#In your code, you might want to create a function called getSaveFileLocation(). This would return the full file path to the folder.
#BR
#CODE
char *getSaveFileLocation() {
  char *result = 0;
  //find the file path here
  return result;
}
#ENDCODE
#To get the filepath we use the Windows specific function SHGetKnownFolderPath, passing in the folder Id we want-FOLDERID_LocalAppData. It looks like this:
#CODE
PWSTR  win32_wideString_utf16 = 0;
if(SHGetKnownFolderPath(
   FOLDERID_LocalAppData,
   KF_FLAG_CREATE,
   0,
   (PWSTR *)&win32_wideString_utf16
 ) != S_OK) {
  assert(false);
  return result;
 }
#ENDCODE
#We pass in a pointer to a wide string to be filled out since windows use wide strings (2 bytes per character) for Unicode. We want to create this folder if it doesnâ€™t exist by passing in KF_FLAG_CREATE. And we assert false if this function doesnâ€™t succeed.
#This would be it if our program was using wide strings. But unfortunately (or fortunately!) most applications deal with utf8 encoded strings. So we have to do another step of converting it to utf8. Letâ€™s do this:
#CODE
int bufferSize_inBytes = WideCharToMultiByte(
   CP_UTF8,
   0,
   win32_wideString_utf16,
   -1,
   (LPSTR)result, 
   0,
   0, 
   0
 );
 #ENDCODE
#By passing in no buffer length (argument 6), it just gives the resulting string length in bytes that we need to allocate.
#Once we get that back we can now allocate it however you would like to allocate the string. Weâ€™re going to use malloc for instructional purposes.
#CODE
result = malloc(bufferSize_inBytes);
#ENDCODE
#We then call the same function as above, but this time passing in the buffer size.
#CODE
u32 bytesWritten = WideCharToMultiByte(
   CP_UTF8,
   0,
   win32_wideString_utf16,
   -1,
   (LPSTR)result, 
   bufferSize_inBytes,
   0, 
   0
 );
 #ENDCODE
#Yay! Weâ€™ve got our utf8 encoded string of the location of Local folder.
We can make sure we got the full string that weâ€™re supposed to get.
#CODE
assert(bytesWritten == bufferSize_inBytes);
#ENDCODE
#We then free the wide string like so:
#CODE
//NOTE: Free the string
 CoTaskMemFree(win32_wideString_utf16);
#ENDCODE
#We also have to include the header that contains the functions & enums that weâ€™re using.
#CODE
#include <Shlobj.h>
#ENDCODE
#Now finally we have to link to the correct .libs â€” CoTaskMemFree is in Ole32.lib and SHGetKnownFolderPath is in Shell32.lib.
#CODE
cl main.cpp /link Shell32.lib Ole32.lib
#ENDCODE
