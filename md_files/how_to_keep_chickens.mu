I've always wanted to keep chickens. I missed the class in grade 8 where you got to bring chickens home. In this article I'll teach you how to keep chickens with a chicken run. This isn't free range chickens, instead they have a coop to lay eggs in and sleep in, and an area (the chicken run) to scratch around in.

This way seems simpler than free-range since you don't have to worry about where the chickens have got to or if they're digging up your garden beds.
