#You may have heard the term Cognitive Behaviuoral Therapy before and wondered what it's all about. That was me. I saw it recommended as a scientifically proven way to treat depression & anxiety.  But I wondered how learning a theoretical framework could suddenly reduce my bouts of depression?  I want to give you a few key takeaways of CBT and how you can <b>practice</b> it in your everday life.
#BR
#HR
#BR
##1. CBT is a form of self-therapy. 
#BR
#Self therapy is the ability to preform pyscological therapy on yourself, without having an external person. When we have an episode of depression or anxiety, we're not going to be near a therapist steaight away. BY becoming our own theraphist, we are going to me emotionally more resilent, and be able to get ontop of thoughts while they are occuring. This takes us to the next keypoint.
#HR
#BR
##2. Our Emotions & Behaviours are caused by how we interpret the external world. 
#BR
#The CBT framework is based on the premise that our interpretitation of the external world is the cause of our emotions towards it and ourselves, which then govern our behaviours. 
#The events occuring in the world filter through our set of <b>beliefs, thoughts and biases</b>, and from these produce an <b>emotion</b>. These can be unhealthy emotions, which lean us towards self destructive behaviours and healthy emotions, which lean us towards constructive behaviours.  
#The role of CBT is to acknoledge that how we are feeling is the result of our interpretation of the world and our place in it, whether this be concious or not. Our role as self-therapists is bring these interpretations in the form of thoughts, biases & beliefs to the surface to be examined. This allows them to be questioned and ultimatley replaced with healthy alternatives.

##3. Observe your thoughts
#BR
#The first step of using CBT in everday life is to observe your thoughts. Not to judge them as bad or good. Just to see them as they occur. Label them as a thought when you see them happening. The more you become the observor of your thoughts, the easier it is to question and replace eventually them.
#HR
#BR
##4. People interpret events differently. And in doing have different reactions.
#BR
#Two people witnessing the exact same event in the world, can have <b>different interpretations</b> of it. One person may interpret the event as a negative, resulting in negative emotions and behaviours, while another person may interpret it as positive, resulting in positive emotions and behaviours. What's causing the difference? The event is the same, but the two people's <b>thoughts, biases and beliefs</b> are different. 
#BR
#Even if both people interpret the event as a bad thing, their emotional reaction and behaviours to it can be entirely different. For example a relative dying. This could trigger a cascade of self-destructive behaviours by the first person, interpreting the event as "unfair and cruel". Whereas the relative dying could trigger a cascade of positive emotions and behaviours by the second person - although they may interpret the event as sad, the event showed them "life is fleeting and we should seize every moment. They lived a good life and I want to do them proud".

##Example
#BR
#<i>You look out for your elderly Aunt by visiting her every fornight to help around the house. Doing odd jobs she can't, like cleaning the windows and changing the light bulbs. One fortnight, instead of going to visit her, you take an offer up by your friends to go skiing and forget to let her know.  Your Aunt got impatient waiting for you and decided to try and change a lightbulb herself. She lost her balance on the ladder and fell, breaking her hip.</i>
#BR
###Negative response
#You interpret the event as entirely your fault, resulting in a guilty response which is as follows:
#You conclude you've done something terrible and feel deeply guilty. You assume more personal responsibility than may actually be legitimate, discounting or not considering other factors. You may believe that some form of punishment is deserved and/or imminent. 
#You may look for more evidence to support you have done a bad thing, discounting or ignoring competeting evidence. 
#You try to escape your guilty feelings by begging for forgiveness, promising to yourself or others that you'll never do a bad thing again. You may punish yourself for you wrong-doing. 
#BR 
###Positive response
#You interpret the event as unfortunate and wished you had contacted your Aunt, but ultimately understand it is not entirely your fault.
#You look at actions in context and with understanding before making a judgement about what has happened. You consider mitigating factors of the situation and do not believe that punishment is deserved and/or imminent.
#You don’t look for further evidence that you've done something bad, neither do you look for or assume that others hold you responsible for what has happened.
#You face up to the healthy pain that comes with knowing that you could have done better. You may ask for forgiveness but understand you are capable of forgiving yourself. You understand the reasons for your wrongdoing and act on that understanding. You avoid defensiveness and excuse-making.
#You are able to challenge negative thoughts that arise with competitng viewpoints - She could have rang someone else. She could have waited till the end of the day to get in contact.

##5. We can challenge our interpretations of events.
#BR     
#Our interpretations of events is not the final world. Our brain creates our interpretation based on past experiences, following the path of least resistant. Although this might use less energy by our brain in that moment, it can be detrimental to our well-being. 
#We have the ability to question our interpretation, asking whether what has been thought is actually the truth. We become scientists of our thoughts, instead of seeing them as facts that are unquestionable, as Cognitive Behavioural Therapists we treat them as hypotheses that need to be tested. 
#BR
#There are multiple ways of challenging them. 
#BR
#<b>1. We can find an alternative explanation of what has happened.</b> Say you suddenly find a friend is avoiding you. They won't answer your messages and you saw them turn the other walking down the street. You may think 
#<i>"That person is being very rude. Suddenly we're friends, next I can't even talk to them. How dare they! I'm going to give them a piece of my mind!".</i>
#If we catch ourselves having this thought, we don't have to take it at face value. 
#We can question whether this is the only explanation. A relative might have died and they can't cope to talk to anyone at the moment or they might be going through a job loss or breakup. By coming up with alternative interpretations, we are able to step back from our immeditate one, lessening the intensity of it. Even if any of our alternatives aren't true, we've allowed the possibility of alternative interpretations. 
#<b>2. We can gain perspective on the situation by surveying .</b> Asking other people whether they experience similar experiences and how they deal with them can help normalize intense feelings you're having. Say you have distrubing thoughts of killing your family. From the event that's happened in our own head, we could interpret this as evidence that we're not safe or we can't be trusted, resulting in unhealthy emotions and behaviours like trying to never be left alone with family members and trying to rid your mind of any of these thoughts happening again. However  

we can gain perspective on the situation by seeing how other people interpret the situation, 

#What thoughts are causing you to feel the way you do? What beliefs or identities are causing you to interpret this event as a bad thing? 



- Treat our thoughts as hypothesis - we need to test them & we need to find contridictory data. 

- Consider an alternative if you have an extreme thought or take an extreme stance 

- Pose questions to your thoughts: How would someone in a thrid world country react to this? How would I react if I wasn't as tired? What if this is a negative filter I processing in this?   Can I find someone of a different stance and see what they say?  



developing flexible, tolerant, and accepting attitudes.



"A crucial step in CBT is to make the thought–feeling link or B-to-C connection;
that is, seeing clearly for yourself the connection between what goes through
your mind and your resulting emotions. When you see this connection, it can
help you to make much more sense of why to challenge and change your
thoughts."


According to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, extreme & rigid thoughts & beliefs have more tendency to lead to unhealthy emotions & behaviors, as they leave little wiggle room for alternative realities. Beware when you pick up an extreme belief with little flexibility.





ALBERT ELLIS

“There are three musts that hold us back: I must do well. You must treat me well. And the world must be easy”. Albert Ellis started from the idea that our emotional discomfort is not caused directly by adversity but by ourselves, it is our irrational beliefs and thoughts that generate that suffering.

These irrational beliefs end up dictating our emotions and decisions, mediating our relationship with the world and the problems that arise. That is why it is essential to be aware of their existence and irrationality, to place more adaptive thoughts in their place.

12 irrational, common beleifs we have:

1. Meaningful people should love us and accept what we do

2. To be valuable, it is essential to be very competent and realize great achievements in all possible areas

3. Certain people are vile, evil and infamous and should be blamed and punished for their perversity

4. It is terrible that things do not go the way we planned them

5. Human misfortune is due to external causes

6. If something is dangerous or scary, one must feel very restless and obsessed with the possibility of it happening

7. It is easier to avoid certain responsibilities and difficulties in life than to face them

8. It is normal to depend on others because we need someone stronger to trust - the only person we need to depend on is ourselves. 

The more we depend on the others, the less we choose for ourselves and the more we let ourselves be carried away by the opinions and desires of the others. The more we leave the important decisions in the hands of the others, the less opportunities we will have to learn, so that we feed the cycle of dependence and insecurity.

9. When something from the past shocked us, it will continue to affect us indefinitely

10. We must feel very concerned about the problems of the others

11. You always have to maintain control and aim for perfection

12. We do not control our emotions, happiness is something that simply happens
