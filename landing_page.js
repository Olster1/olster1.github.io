			<h2>Bigger Projects:</h2>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Puzzle Game</h3>\
				<div>I made a puzzle game called <a href="https://makinggamesinc.itch.io/feoh-the-fitter">Feoh the Fitter</a>. It was based off a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRshtU-CJK0">prototype</a> I made a couple of years prior to it.\
				I used it to explore \'explorative\' gameplay, trying to find interesting consequences from a minimal rule set.</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>3d Game Engine</h3>\
				<div>I\'m currently making a modern <a href="https://github.com/Olster1/easy_engine">3d game engine</a>. You can see some videos of it here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE2meuutd1A">Clouds</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dpEgPGi91M">terrain</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH3cZx1Acw4">editor panel</a></div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>2d Platformer RPG Game</h3>\
				<div>I\'m working with an artist & game designer to make an RPG platformer. You can see more about the project <a href="https://www.therookies.co/projects/130">here</a> and see a gameplay video. It is made using Unity, and is still very early in production.</div>\
			</div>\
			<hr>\
			<h2>Learning Projects:</h2>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Maze Algorithm</h3>\
				<div>A program to explore generative maze algorithms. A video of it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qp-9OZlevc">here</a>. It uses an A* algorithm, for the enemy (blue dot) to find the player (the red dot). You can download it <a href="./apps/MazeRunner.jar">here</a>.  Note: need Java installed to run</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Game of Life</h3>\
				<div>A game of life implementation.  I like the idea of the game of life, where there is a super minimal rule set (like four simple rules), and you can get very emeregent behaviuor. You can download it <a href="./apps/gameOfLife.jar">here</a>.  Note: need Java installed to run</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>3d Software Renderer</h3>\
				<div>I made a 3d software renderer (just C code drawing into a frame buffer). You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SlpMrJx2yk">here</a>. I didn\'t get to the point of perspective correct texturing, or more advance ideas.</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>2d Impulse Physics</h3>\
				<div>I really like physics engines, and the idea of building a world of physics in code. Using Chris Hecker\'s <a href="https://chrishecker.com/Rigid_Body_Dynamics">physics articles</a>. You can watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwFw-zqN2E">here</a> of my implementation, but have alot to go to building an actual useable engine.</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Generative Sound Game</h3>\
				<div>I really like  generative sound games. I had a go at implmenting a synthisizer that produces the tones by making the waveform, and adding harmonics to make it richer. The game idea was to have a generative music game, where you build a garden, and by adding new plants to it, you develop a garden full of sounds. You can watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJv4vTHKzGQ">here</a>.Still sounds like a good idea.</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
				<h3>Raster To Vector program</h3>\
				<div>I made a image to vector program, that converts images to a svg format. Here is a video of an early <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROMa4jlt8MY">implementation.</a> Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Olster1/PhotoCog">source code</a>. I is still very buggy, and can only really handle images less then 400px x 400px. The colors don\'t really work, but got it to a point that makes a good outline of the shape, using beizer curves. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qh9Dh5BOf0&feature=youtu.be">Here</a> is a video of the UI I made for it.\
				<br />\
				This is an example: <img style="width: 200px;" src="head1.png"> -> <img style="width: 300px;" src="face.png"></div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Special Relativity explanation</h3>\
				<div>I like intuitive explanations, I made <a href="apps/timeClockProject.jar">this program</a> to show an intuitive reason why time slows down for people travelling at fast speed, and aren\'t in your frame of reference. Press arrow keys to move the \'light clock\' and space bar to change frame of reference. The idea was taken from Brian Cox\'s \'Why does e=mc^2\' book. Note: need Java installed to run</div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Aristotle\'s Wheel Paradox</h3>\
			<p>In the Greek work \'Mechanica\', Aritstotle put forward a paradox in which there are two wheels, a smaller wheel within a larger wheel. Galilio\'s resolution to this paradox was that a circle is made up of infetesismal lines. He showed this by studying how polygons such as a square or triangle performed within the paradox. He noticed that the inner shapes don\'t stay flat on their line, instead they produce gaps. The actual flat contacts add up to their corresponding perimeter. </p>\

			<h2>Non programming stuff: </h2>\
			<div class="info-card">\
				<h3>Stop Motion Video</h3>\
				<div>I made a stop motion art piece you can watch <a href="">here</a>.</div>\
				<img src="1.png" ><img src="2.png" ><img src="3.png" ><img src="4.png" ><img src="5.png" ><img src="6.png" >\

			<div class="info-card">\
			<h3>Guitar</h3>\
				<div>I used to play guitar alot. Here are some videos of me playing a while ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Mhv0D2dVc">Improvising of a minor loop.</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_zG4qrxg00">Sailing Guitar improvising.</a></div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
				<h3>Music Recordings</h3>\
				<div>These are more recent recordings of me on <a href="https://olivermarsh1.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp.</a></div>\
			</div>\
			<div class="info-card">\
				<h3>Short Video Compositions</h3>\
				<div>I like making videos from footage. Here are some I\'ve made: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASHajCOFcs">Me kayaking</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASHajCOFcs">Exploring Sydney beaches</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szAZM-nh7ls">, a video about fire<a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yoiceewTk8&t=31s">, a video of where I grew up in North Queensland, Australia.</a></div>\
