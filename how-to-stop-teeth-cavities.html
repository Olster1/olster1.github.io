<h1>How to Stop Teeth Cavities</h1><br><p>
Who likes teeth cavities and dental problems? No one! So how do we stop teeth cavities and create a better environment for our teeth?  The answer comes in two parts. First, create the <strong>right microbiome</strong> inside your mouth to help repair and stop cavities. The second part: <strong>provide the minerals to be available for the repairs</strong>.   If we're not providing this, no matter how healthy our microbiome is, the raw materials aren't available to fill in the cavities.  In this post I'll talk about how to boost these two things, so you can have the amazing teeth you deserve.</p>
<br><h2>Create an Alkaline Environment to Stop Teeth Cavities</h2><br><p>
The first thing we need to do is create an <strong>alkaline </strong>environment inside our mouths.  A lot of the foods we eat are either acidic or promote the growth of acid-creating bacteria, which in turn create an acidic environment. This leads to the cavities we sorely want to avoid.   You may know of the classic foods that do this such as sugar in soft drinks and lollies, but a lot of foods you wouldn't suspect are acidic such as coffee, cocao/cocoa, and leafy greens like spinach &amp; kale (from the oxalic acids - this is the gritty feeling after eating them [3]).  Not that we avoid them, but want to move the pH of our mouth to an alkaline environment overall.  We do this with Baking Soda [1] (also called Bi-Carb of Soda).   </p>
<br><p>
Baking Soda is basic (pH &gt; 7) and creates the right environment for the microbes we are after.  Use it as a mouth wash after eating foods (concentrating on acidic foods) as this has been shown to lower the acidic-loving bacteria [1].  As well as a mouth wash, get a <strong>tooth powder </strong>with it in. That's right a powder not paste. Toothpaste is so not where it's at. Most tooth powders are a mixture of baking soda and clay minerals. <a href="https://au.iherb.com/pr/Primal-Life-Organics-Dirty-Mouth-Toothpowder-Black-Spearmint-1-oz-28-g/87078">Here is an example.</a></p>
<hr><br><h2>Filling in the Cavities</h2><br><p>
The bentonite clay found in tooth powders is part two of how we avoid cavities: by providing the right minerals to repair our teeth. Bentonite clay contains minerals that can be used to repair our teeth.  Along with brushing our teeth with a mixture of baking soda and bentonite clay, we want to eat a diet with adequate fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D &amp; K). This information is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_A._Price">Dr. Weston A. Price's</a> pioneering studies into healthy teeth. </p>
<br><p>
In 1939, Dr. Price published&nbsp;<em>Nutrition and Physical Degeneration</em> [2], a study of tribes who hadn't come into contact with the western diet (high flour &amp; sugar).  He traveled to various isolated parts of the world, studying the health of traditional groups such as the Eskimos, Indian tribes in Canada and the Florida Everglades, South sea islanders, Aborigines in Australia, Maoris in New Zealand, Peruvian and Amazonian Indians and tribesmen in Africa.   </p>
<br><p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=weston+price+teeth+photos&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU908AU908&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03ueRveOnKfPgNoqZr6ATj0WlR9fw:1606377460281&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJtZSv3p_tAhXBgeYKHVqiDYAQ_AUoAXoECAQQAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The teeth of these tribes</a> were found to be in perfect health, without the common dental abnormalities &amp; teeth cavities he had seen in western culture.  He concluded it was caused by malnutrition due to a western-based diet. In particular the lack of fat-soluble vitamins found in butter, ghee, raw milk (cold-pressed raw milk is becoming more available which retains the enzymes that pasteurization destroys), wild-caught fish &amp; pasture-raised/wild animals, and an increase in acidic causing foods like grains and sugar. </p>
<hr><br><h2>Oil Pulling</h2><br><p>
Oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic practice of swishing oil in your mouth for 20minutes or more.  It has a host of benefits for dental health [5]. It removes toxins, provides minerals to your teeth &amp; moistens your gums [3].  Although oil pulling provides a myriad of dental benefits, it can be quite time consuming and a hassle doing it each day.    An alternative to oil pulling is the bentonite clay in your tooth powder. It provides similar benefits oil pulling does, but in two minutes instead of 20 minutes required for oil pulling [3].  Another addition to providing your gums &amp; teeth with nutrients as well as reducing inflammation [3] is <strong>rubbing them with olive oil after brushing your teeth</strong>.  </p>
<hr><br><h2>Xylitol</h2><br><p>
Xylitol is a sugar alcohol and is used as a healthy alternative to sugar. It has been shown to reduce dental cavities [6].  You can dissolve it in water and swish it in your mouth. Also eating foods that contain it like healthy cakes &amp; drinks is another method. My favorite method is <a href="https://au.iherb.com/pr/Epic-Dental-Xylitol-Gum-Sugar-Free-Spearmint-50-Pieces/64333?gclid=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETzrVK_aZYDHX0VdoAi9s3fnd4tiNGGpckRPASGGn8kF5wcyCeZZC9IaAoo-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xylitol gum.</a> You get all the benefits of chewing gum while coating your teeth with xylitol, helping stop teeth cavities. Definitely a win for me.  </p>
<hr><br><h2>Mouth Scraper</h2><br><p>
A tongue scraper is exactly that, something to scrape your tongue with. It's another Aryvedic practice that improves dental hygiene.  Researchers found that using a tongue scraper twice a day for seven days reduced the overall incidence of the bad bacteria in the mouth, which causes bad breath &amp; dental decay [7]. This is an easy addition to add to your tooth hygeine practice. </p>
