          <h3>
          Self Development: 
          </h3>
          <p>
            How to find more Purpose & Clarity:
          </p>
          <p> 
            1. Rate yourself throughout the day to see how well your doing 
          <p>
          </p>
            2. Observe things you like & don't like during the day. Take note & try to do more of that the next day. 
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Get a mentor/coach for what your trying to achieve. There is someone else out there doing the same thing your trying to do, & have done it at an exceptional standard. Read biographies or join their online courses. 
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Observe things your doing our of obligation, expectations or reactions. You want to move beyond this. 
          </p>
           <p>
            6. Slow down & enjoy what your doing in that moment. If it's playing with your kids do that fully, if it's doing your art do that fully, if it's talking on the phone to your family do that fully.

            <b>Use annoyance as a cue to stop & breath.</b>

            Three reasons you might be feeling horrible: 
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Fatigue
          </p>
          <p>
            Haven't slept well, haven't eaten enough of the right foods. Haven't been doing enough exercise. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Triggered, annoyed, unsettled or upset at something that happened earlier in the day. Someone cut you off in traffic, had a bad interaction with someone. 
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Rumination
          </p>
          <p>
            Replaying events & emotions over & over in our head. Playing out arguments in out head. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ways to <b>stop</b> feeling horrible: 
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Get up, breath, stretch, have a glass of water & choose your <b>next act of integrity</b>. This might be something as simple as cleaning up, or putting a load of washing on. What ever makes you feel like your taking back control & moving forward in your life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Get up & move, go for a walk or do some pushups. 
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Change the enviroment. Get out of the house, go for a walk or drive. 
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Read something inspirational like a self improvement book or quote, or watch something inspirational on youtube.

          <h3>
          Programming: 
          </h3>
          <p>
            My Game idea: A space game where your the pilot of your ship & you have to save the galaxy from an influx of occurances. The actual gameplay is a rogue like infinity scroll run (but it does end), and is more than just get as many points. For example you might collect items that help you upgrade your ship, or find a rare item that you can use on a later level. And the life points is the ship parts like the hull, engine & windscreen. And as you hit things like debris you lose a life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There will also be boses that move with you so the level changes to randomly picking from the boss level, where the 'room' will depend on what the boss is doing, like the boss is in it's cool off period, so dodoge all these obstacles. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Also you can choose your path on the track so you can choose as you go. And feel more like your exploring. Like it will diverge at some point. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be three 'game modes' to the game. 
            <p>1. The main infinity scroll part where you shoot debris, collect items, fight enemies & explore.</p>
            <p>2. An overworld where you click on different star systems & looks more like a board game. So it's 2d & there will be different people giving you different missions. Say, this star system has an influx of asteroids. You need to go clear it out. Mission added to misson log. Then you can have a look at your items or missions. You can also sleep to restore fatigue or go into a mechanic to fix your ship, if not you'll have damage when you begin a new level. And there will be a star shop where you can buy items that you can use in the level, like a quick repair. (Think Dicey Dungeons? for the overworld setup where each node is connected & there are dead ends. And it's uses your fuel up.)</p> 
            <p>3. Talking to people. This gives context to your missions & a want to help these people. Thinking more like a comic book 2d style where your on one side & the text plays out where you can choose an option (think zelda, elder scrolls). </p>   
            <br>
            <p>
              The other 'Game Modes':
              <br>
              4. Title screen (with cool music. Aquamarine game has cool music, also Noita).
              <br>
              5. Save slot. 
              <p>
