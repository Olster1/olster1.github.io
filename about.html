<h3>ABOUT ME </h3><h2>What I'm doing noe</h2><p>
Currently I'm focusing on:</p>
<hr><br><h2>(1) Being a better parent - I'm a parent to two kids and soom another one. I want to be the best parent I can possibley be. To me this means:</h2><br><p>
1.  Developing strong bonds with the kids by spending quality time playing together, mutual points of interest - exercise, swimming, outdoors</p>
<br><p>
2.  Being a role model - both in things I do and that way I treat people and myself. Showing them how to set boundaries for themselves. </p>
<br><p>
3.  Listening to them, and letting them feel heard. Looking them in the eye. </p>
<br><p>
4.  Not praising or rewarding them, instead saying how what they did, made me feel. Pointing out obsevations I make - showing them I'm interested in what they're doing.  WHen they do something you like (pointing stuff in the bin), not making a big deal out of it. </p>
<br><p>
5.  Encouraging deep play - providing the oppurrunities and role modelling how to have fun. </p>
<br><br><h2>(2)Making an income through coding. </h2><br><p>
I love coding. It brings be great joy. Sometimes I think too much joy. I enjoy solving problems and creating things people will like. I've yet to make this a full time job, but it is my dream in the near future to code as my income source. </p>
<p>
To do this I'm creating a yoga app and a numerology app. </p>
<h2>(3) Get a lot fitter and get a six pack. </h2><h2>(4) Eating healthier</h2><h2>(5) Meditating regularly & BREATHing </h2><p>
I like making apps (which I'm trying to make as my primary source of income), working out (calisthenics), reading books (mainly non-fiction), learning to be more compassionate & kinder, meditation, parenting & travelling. And on the blog I'll write about all these, my thoughts on them & what I'm doing to get more acquainted with them. I hope you enjoy reading. </p>
