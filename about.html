<h3>ABOUT ME </h3><br><br><hr><p>

(1) Being a better parent</p>
<br><p>
I'm a parent to two kids and soom another one. I want to be the best parent I can possibley be. To me this means:</p>
<br><p>
1.  Developing strong bonds with the kids by spending quality time playing together, mutual points of interest - exercise, swimming, outdoors</p>
<br><p>
2.  Being a role model - both in things I do and that way I treat people and myself. Showing them how to set boundaries for themselves. </p>
<br><p>
#3.  Listening to them, and letting them feel heard. Looking them in the eye. </p>
<br><p>
#4.  Not praising or rewarding them, instead saying how what they did, made me feel. Pointing out obsevations I make - showing them I'm interested in what they're doing.  WHen they do something you like (pointing stuff in the bin), not making a big deal out of it. </p>
<br><p>
#5.  Encouraging deep play - providing the oppurrunities and role modelling how to have fun. </p>
<br><hr><h2>(2)Making an income through coding. </h2><br><p>
I love coding. It brings be great joy. Sometimes I think too much joy. I enjoy solving problems and creating things people will like. I've yet to make this a full time job, but it is my dream in the near future to code as my income source. </p>
<br><p>
To do this I'm creating a game and game lessons.</p>
<br><h2>(3) Get a lot fitter.</h2><br><p>
A lot of my energy and anxiety is linked to if I've done exercise or not. I used to run a lot but now have been concetrating on strength exercises as this seems to be better for my health in the long run (pun not intended!). I've got a small workout I try to do each day involving body weight exercises. </p>
<br><h2>(4) Eating healthier</h2><br><p>
These is both for my health and role modelling to my kids. I've been trying to eat more whole foods with alot of different colors on the plate. Lot's of fibre, healthy fats and a good amount of protien.    </p>
<br><h2>(5) Meditating regularly & BREATHing </h2><br><p>
I'm always trying to learn to be more compassionate & kinder to people.  Exploring meditation - this has been just regularly trying to count to ten without getting distracted. </p>
<br><hr><p>
On  the blog I'll write about all these, my thoughts on them & what I'm doing to get more acquainted with them. I hope you enjoy reading. </p>
