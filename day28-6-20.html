<h1>28/06/20</h1><hr><br><h2>What we did today:</h2><br><p>
#Today I woke up pretty good, quite early at 6:00am with Willow. She was crying but was alright after about 10minutes. We have been watching Thomas the Tank engine and 'Go Jetters'.  Willow likes doing stuff in the lounge room while she watches the TV. We also go looking for the Archie.  Willow calls all cats Archie now even when she sees a picture of a cat.</p>
<br><p>
#Once Jessie woke up we went to the Uradlia Cafe & got a spinach parstie which we ate in the car. Willow fell asleep there, so we ate them in the car. When Willow woke up we walked over to the cafe but she didn't want to go on the play equipment, so we had a look in the Bar Dining area which was nice. Willow then got a cookie & Jessie got some Carrot Cake. </p>
<br><p>
#In the afternnon we didn't do too much, just TV and playing in the lounge room & Jessie did some editing of a photo she talk of me as a Viking photoshopped in front of a 'Long House' picture. It looks very good.</p>
<br><p>
#Had vegies bone broth for dinner which Willow really likes cauliflower. Jessie had a pre-cooked meal (braised beef) & I cooked an extra meal for me (veggies cooked in butter with tuna). It was very nice.</p>
<br><p>
#I also did work on the Yoga App. I finished debugging the time chooser, which I'm pretty sure doesn't have any more bugs in it (fingers crossed). Next to get it hooked up to actually setting the time. </p>
