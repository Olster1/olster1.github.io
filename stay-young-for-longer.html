#Most of us are probably a bit scared about age-related conditions happening to our family, friends &amp; ourselves, and most of us have been witness to age-related conditions. Research is showing that diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer's, Diabetes &amp; Strokes have a common root cause - the process of aging.  This blog post will show you how to slow, stop &amp; reverse aging, and stay younger for longer.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Concentrate on <strong>HIIT (high-intensity interval training) exercises</strong>. Whatever gets you out of breath is better. This could be as easy as running upstairs or a hill, short sprint on an exercise bike, skipping rope, or sprint in the pool.&nbsp; The doctor, Michael Mosley has good stuff on this (<a href="https://documentarylovers.com/film/the-truth-about-exercise/">https://documentarylovers.com/film/the-truth-about-exercise/</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Do <strong>strength exercises</strong> like weights, or sports like rock-climbing, kayaking or surfing.&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Do more movement. Look for exercises that have a<strong> range of movements, like swimming and Pilates</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Note on exercise. It’s by applying short controlled stresses to the body that activate our longevity genes. So a lot of these are about stressing our body in this way. But it also means not stressing our body when it is run down, or pushing ourselves too far over the edge. It’s finding that balance.&nbsp; </p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Doing exercise while run-down is more detrimental to our bodies than if we rested.  Rest on the days you've had a lack of sleep, feeling particularly stressed or run down, and go harder on the days you know you are feeling well.  </p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Although walking is good, &amp; you should do more, it’s not activating our longevity genes in the same way as HIIT &amp; strength training are.&nbsp; </p>
<br><p>

<br><h2><strong>Eat less often (fast &amp; skip meals)</strong></h2><br><p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#This is a dreaded one by many. Basically <strong>eating less food less often</strong> (or doing intermittent fasting) can activate our longevity genes. Again it’s a short (although doesn't feel like it) controlled stress we put on our bodies, that activates a very ancient repair system in our genes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<br><p>
#<ol><li>Leaving the table before we feel fully full is one way to eat less.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Intermittent fasting</strong> (in which we restrict our calorie window not the amount of calories.) is another way. &nbsp; Again Michael Mosely has good stuff on this, particularly his book ‘Fast 800’. There are different types of intermittent fasting, so choose one that works for you. There are ways people do fasting in which you still can consume fat (such as the bulletproof fast), which may also work better for you.&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/26189891642/michael-mosley-eat-fast-and-live-longer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Mosley ‘Eat, Fast and Live Longer’ documentary </a>)</li></ol></p>

#Fasting is a bit like exercise, in that it can be hard at the start to get in a habit &amp; last very long before stopping, but as we learn to control our stress response, &amp; ‘make it through’ more fasts, the easier it becomes. You don't want your body to become overly stressed. If so you do feel like it is, it might be a good idea to eat &amp; try again another day.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Through exposing our bodies to cold temperatures, we activate our longevity genes. Ways you can do this is if you live in a cold climate, <strong>go for a brisk walk in the cold without a jumper</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#<strong>Going swimming in a cold sea, creek or lake</strong>. It doesn’t have to be long, people do it for 30 seconds to four minutes or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Taking a <strong>cold shower or setting up a cold tub</strong> (a chest freezer you keep water in that is 0-4 degrees celsius, and sit in it for 30seonds to 4minutes. This might be a good option if you live in a hot climate.)&nbsp; At your exercise centre, there might be cold pools you can go in. You can jump into a hot shower or sauna straight away afterward &amp; still enjoy the benefits (remember, it’s the short controlled stress we are after).</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#There are some places that offer <strong>cryotherapy </strong>in most cities. It’s a chamber you stand in that drops to -110 degrees Celsius using liquid nitrogen.&nbsp; (Apparently, it is a lot more tolerable then cold showers.)</p>
<br><p>

<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#<strong>Cold therapy could be the easiest method with the potential for greatest results.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Note: If you can combine exercise with cold water exposure, like swimming in a cold sea or creek, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>

<br><hr><br><h2><strong>Exposure to hot temperatures</strong></h2><br><p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#The main one here is taking regular <strong>saunas </strong>or <strong>hot baths</strong> like in geothermal pools, or just a hot bath at your house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#Note: For both cold &amp; hot exposures, no matter how much you do, it’s going to help, but trying to do it once each day (again as long as your body is not stressed or run-down) is great. People who do cold therapy, jump straight in a hot shower or sauna afterward, so a good way of doing both hot &amp; cold.&nbsp;</p>

#<a href="https://lifespanbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Eating less animal protein</strong> can engage our longevity genes</a>, &amp; activates our ancient survival repair system. If you eat meat seven days a week, consider cutting back to three to four days a week.&nbsp; (This could be the reason we see higher rates of heart disease in people who eat meat because their longevity genes are getting engaged less.)</p>
<br><p>

#Aim to eat stressed plants. These are normally plants with much deeper colors in their stem. <strong>Organic &amp; home-grown plants</strong> are usually a better bet for this reason.

Your body produces less as you age, &amp; is responsible for keeping our body together.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Turmeric </strong>or <strong>Curcumin </strong>- helps reduce inflammation. Make sure you take with oil for best ingestion.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Vitamin C</strong> - can find it at most shops. Vitamin C is a very low investment, high reward antioxidant, that is key in a lot of biological processes including production of collagen.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Vitamin D</strong> - this is the molecule created from being in the Sun. It’s recommended that it’s taken with Vitamin K &amp; Vitamin A. These are normally added in the same tablet.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fish oil tablets</strong> for omega-3. It’s suggested you look for tablets made from fish low in the food chain like Krill.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Glutathione </strong>- another antioxidant that can help reduce DNA breakage.&nbsp; (Milk Thistle supplements also work by increasing the body's production of Glutathione).</li><li><strong>B12</strong> <strong>supplement - </strong>especially if you're on a vegan or vegetarian diet.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#There have been a number of drugs that have been shown to increase the effectiveness of our longevity genes &amp; reduce the effects of aging.<strong> (I strongly urge you to talk to a doctor before taking these supplements. Since NAD &amp; Reservatol</strong> <strong>are sold as supplements, extensive long term human trials have not been conducted, and have no way of knowing potential side effects)</strong>. I also would recommend younger people (less the 40yrs old)&nbsp; to not take these if they don’t have any premature aging conditions. There should be naturally high levels of NAD+ present already in their body, and by doing the above activities will create more. As we age (40+), the natural levels of NAD+ start declining.&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><br><p>
#The anti-aging supplements are:&nbsp;</p>
<br><p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<br><p>
<!-- wp:list --></p>
<br><p>
#<ul><li><strong>NMN </strong>(Nicotinamide mononucleotide) or you’ll also see <strong>NAD+</strong>. NMN is the precursor to NAD+. This supplement is quite in-expensive and has shown in quite a lot of studies to be effective at reducing aging.&nbsp; As we get older, we reduce our production of this molecule naturally.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you type nmn into google you get a lot of different brand options. I’ve never bought it, &amp; don’t know what the different brands are. These one’s are australian owned &amp; operated: <a href="https://eternumlabs.com.au/">https://eternumlabs.com.au/</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.extralifespan.com/">https://www.extralifespan.com/</a></li><li><strong>Resveratrol</strong>. This is another molecule that acts similar to NAD+. It naturally comes from the skins of grapes &amp; wines, and their health properties are suggested to be linked to this molecule. You normally find resveratrol paired with NMN when buying it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Metformin </strong>is the drug taken by people who have type-2 diabetes. It has been shown to again engage our longevity genes and reduce age related illnesses (cancer, Alziemer’s, strokes &amp; diabetes). You have to have a prescription for metformin from a doctor to get it in Australia (basically only if you have diabetes, but it is getting more well known as an anti-aging drug, so may be able to get it for this). Again consult a doctor before using it.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>

#<strong>Sleeping better</strong> helps speed up DNA repair (this could be the main reason why we need sleep).&nbsp; Concentrating on the <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>not just the quantity </strong>is the route to go. This is through things like less blue light before bed, reducing your stress levels, darkening out the room, reducing noise, setting the room temperature to ideal, using weighted blankets, improving room airflow, not snoring (sleeping on your side you, or getting special pillows or mouthpieces to help).&nbsp; Also eating certain foods before bed (like prebiotic fiber &amp; avoiding others like sugar) can help enter a deeper sleep (See Michael Mosley’s ‘Fast Asleep’ book).&nbsp;</p>
