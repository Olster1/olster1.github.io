<h1>27/06/20</h1><hr><br><h2>What we did today:</h2><br><p>
#Today I woke up pretty sick with a head cold. The night before I had felt sick but thought I had just overdone the exercise. But in the morning was definitely a head cold. I had a shower which always feels nice (very hot, but no cold today). Then had a sleep thanks to Jessie looking after Willow & was very kind about the whole thing.   When I woke up about 1pm I felt much better and cooked some noodle soup with beef bone broth, Konjac noodles and frozen vegies. Willow really like it and enjoyed eating it with me on the coach.  </p>
<br><p>
#We then watch tv & played in the lounge room the rest of the day. Willow liked watching Arthur & had a sleep for a bit. I worked on the Yoga App making the time selector 'plugin' which I hope to sell on the Unity Asset store as another source of passive income. </p>
<br><p>
#Jessie has been getting into photograph & enjoying taking photos and using her camera. She wants to get a new camera soon. </p>
